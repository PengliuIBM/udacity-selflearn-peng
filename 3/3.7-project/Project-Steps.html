The high level steps of the project include:

Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch) - Here, you'll visualize the dataset, process it for training, and then build a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify the landmarks. You'll also describe some of your decisions around data processing and how you chose your network architecture. You will then export your best network using Torch Script.
Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning) - Next, you'll investigate different pre-trained models and decide on one to use for this classification task. Along with training and testing this transfer-learned network, you'll explain how you arrived at the pre-trained network you chose. You will also export your best transfer learning solution using Torch Script
Deploy your algorithm in an app - Finally, you will use your best model to create a simple app for others to be able to use your model to find the most likely landmarks depicted in an image. You'll also test out your model yourself and reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of your model.
Each of these three major steps is carried out in a corresponding Jupyter Notebook that you will be provided in the project starter kit. So there are three notebooks that will guide you in your project work.

Starter Code and Instructions
Starter code is provided to you in the project workspace, and is also available for you to download if you prefer to work locally. Please follow the detailed instructions contained in the following three notebooks:

cnn_from_scratch.ipynb: Create a CNN from scratch
transfer_learning.ipynb: Use transfer learning
app.ipynb: Deploy your best model in an app. At the end of this notebook you will also generate the archive file that you will submit for review
Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the project rubric(opens in a new tab). Review this rubric thoroughly, and evaluate your project against the rubric before submission. Your project must satisfy every criterion in the rubric for you to pass.

We have also written some tests for each step of the process to help you self-diagnose the most common problems. You will be running these tests as part of the development process, as described in the notebooks. Do not skip ahead if the tests are not passing. When tests fail, they will usually provide some clear guidance on what went wrong.

Project Submission
At the end of the app.ipynb notebook there are instructions on how to generate a file with a name like submission_2022-03-31T00h55m.tar.gz that contains all your notebooks and code. If you worked in the Project Workspace, you will download that file from the workspace to your machine. If you worked locally the file will already be on your machine, in the same directory as the notebooks. After you have obtained the file, go to the Project Submission page and submit it.
